<hr />
<p>Born and raised in Israel, now living in Berlin. I have years of experience in Graphic Design and Marketing.

  In the last couple of years I've made the transition to UX Design because I find the mission of solving real Users' problems and creating great experiences for all of us to be very exciting and more precise then my previous line of work.
  My intention, when approaching a design challenge, is to reach the junction that will please the experience of the user, with no hindrance, that will put the clientsâ€™ mission and image in the foreground, and that will be altogether no too bad to look at.</p>
